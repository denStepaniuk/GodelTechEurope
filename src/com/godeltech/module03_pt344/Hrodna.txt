The modern city of Grodno originated as a small fortress and a fortified trading outpost maintained
by the Rurikid
princes on the border with the lands of the Baltic tribal union of the Yotvingians. The first
reference to Grodno
dates to 1005.[3]

The official foundation year is 1127. At this year Grodno was mentioned in the Primary Chronicle
as Goroden and
located at a crossing of numerous trading routes, this Lithuanian settlement,[4][better source
needed] possibly
originating as far as the late 10th century, became the capital of a poorly attested[by whom?]
but separate[according to whom?] principality[according to whom?][dubious – discuss], ruled by
Yaroslav the Wise's
grandson and his descendants.[3]
Along with Navahrudak, Grodno was regarded as the main city on the western borderlands of Black
Ruthenia[neologism?].
The border region neighboured the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was often attacked by various
invaders, especially the
Teutonic Knights. In the 1240–1250s the Grodno area, as well as the most of Black
Ruthenia[neologism?], was controlled
by princes of Lithuanian origin (Mindaugas and others) to form the Baltic state—Grand Duchy of
Lithuania—on these
territories. After the Prussian uprisings a large population of Old Prussians sought refuge in
the region. The famous
Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas was the prince of Grodno from 1376 to 1392, and he stayed there
during his preparations
for the Battle of Grunwald (1410). Since 1413, Grodno had been the administrative center of a
powiat in Trakai Voivodeship
