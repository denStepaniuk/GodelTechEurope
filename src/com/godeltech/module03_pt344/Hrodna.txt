After the outbreak of World War I,
Grodno was occupied by Germany
(Sept 3 1915) and ceded by Bolshevist Russia
under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918. After
the war the German government permitted a
 short-lived state to be set up there, the first
 one with a Belarusian name—the Belarusian People's
 Republic. This declared its independence from Russia
 in March 1918 in Minsk (known at that time as Mensk),
 but then the BNR's Rada (Council) had to leave Minsk and
 led to Grodno. All this time the military authority in the
 city remained in German hands.[citation needed]
After the outbreak of the Polish–Bolshevik War,
the German commanders of the Ober Ost feared that
the city might fall to Soviet Russia, so on April 27,
1919 they passed authority to Poland. The city was taken
over by the Polish Army the following day and Polish
administration was established in the city. The city was
lost to the Red Army on July 20, 1920 in what became
known as the First Battle of Grodno.[7] The city was also
claimed by Lithuanian government, after it was agreed by
the Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty of 1920 signed on July 12,
1920 in Moscow that the city would be transferred to
Lithuania. However, Soviet defeat in the Battle of
Warsaw made these plans obsolete, and Lithuanian
authority was never established in the city.
Instead, the Red Army organised its last stand
in the city and the Battle of Neman took place there.
On September 23 the Polish Army recaptured the city.
After the Peace Treaty of Riga, Grodno remained in Poland.

Initially, prosperity was reduced due to the fact that the
city remained only the capital of a powiat, while the capital
of the voivodship was moved to Białystok. However, in the late
1920s the city became one of the biggest Polish Army garrisons.
This brought the local economy back on track. Also, the city was a
notable centre of Jewish culture, with roughly 37%
of the city's population being Jewish
